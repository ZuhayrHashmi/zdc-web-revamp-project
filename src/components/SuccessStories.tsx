      solution: "A custom data analytics solution was designed using Alteryx to extract and transform data from internal servers. The transformed data would then be loaded onto a Power BI dashboard consisting of visuals highlighting team performance through average throughput times, KYC pipelines, and error rates post-KYC completion.",

      challenge: "Investment Management firms face complex challenges, especially in Investment Operations. One firm struggled with time-consuming MI (Management Information) reporting, requiring collaboration across global teams and manual data extraction from information systems and spreadsheets. These delays not only hindered efficiency but also posed potential operational and regulatory risks.",
      solution: "The devised solution involved employing a combination of Python and Power BI for data extraction. Python was integrated within the Power BI environment to extract data from systems requiring API connectivity. Additionally, databases such as MongoDB, Denodo, and Microsoft Excel were accessed using Power BI functionality.",

      challenge: "Within a small brokerage business, there were increasing levels of suspicious trading activity where individuals would take advantage of lagging price updates for currency pairs using robotic trading systems. These systems would identify lagging price updates between stock exchanges and the business which was not only costly for the firm but had serious regulatory and reputation implications.",
      solution: "The solution centred around Python, where a sophisticated revenue analytics system was developed and tailored to the organisation's needs. Leveraging Python's advanced data processing capabilities, trade data was extracted and analysed to identify anomalies indicative of suspicious activity. This included assessing the region where the trade originated, the length of time a position was held, and the daily fluctuations in account balance.",
